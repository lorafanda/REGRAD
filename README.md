# Instructions: Using the experiment
## Simple and fool-proof setup
The aim of this setup was to make the use of the experiment simple and fool-proof. For this reason, we implemented an executable file that is script-independent. If you would like to try this approach, the steps are simple

- Download the ReGrad_Motor folder onto your local (Windows) computer.
- In the following link, download the executable file named "ReGrad_MotorTask.exe"
- Save the "ReGrad_MotorTask.exe" in the folder "ReGrad_MotorTask" without changing the structuring of the folder
- Double-click the "ReGrad_MotorTask.exe" file and you are set!

## Getting dirty with the code
We are making the scripts used to run the experiment and the executables available here. In the ReGrad_Motor folder, you will find the ReGrad_MotorTask.py file which is the script used for running the experiments. The requirements file includes *some* libraries needed to run the experiment to help you get started. It is likely that, due to depreciations and other library changes, you will need to suffer the installation process. 

Or use the executable file instead! ;)
